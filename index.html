<h2>More Info & Tips/insights about Cricket</h2><hr/>
Cricket is an exciting sport played between two teams of 11 players, featuring formats like Test matches, which can last up to five days, and shorter formats such as T20. Each game consists of innings where one team bats to score runs while the other bowls and fields to limit runs and take wickets. Effective communication between batsmen is crucial, as is respecting umpires' decisions. The pitch condition can significantly impact play, favoring different types of bowlers, while understanding dismissals like LBW is essential for batsmen. The leather cricket ball affects speed and bounce, so bowlers should pay attention to the seam. Fielding skills, including catching and throwing, are vital for saving runs, and mental toughness is key in high-pressure situations. Overall, cricket combines strategy, skill, and resilience, making it a fascinating sport.<h2></h2><hr/>
